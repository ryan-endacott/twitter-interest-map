An Atlas of the World's Interests
====================

Disclaimer:  In progress and very hacky code (but it works :D).  Examples and more info below.

# What will the atlas look like?

The atlas will be a website full of interactive maps. While viewing any interest map, you can click on a country to see which cities are the most interested in that topic.  The maps above are actual screenshots.


# What does the project do?

We have built a Node.js application to map interests by using data from Twitter's API. We have also mapped a few interests, but we would need a lot more database space to continue mapping.
